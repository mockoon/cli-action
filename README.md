  <h1>@Mockoon/cli GitHub Action</h1>
</div>

Mockoon is the easiest and quickest way to design and run mock APIs. No remote deployment, no account required, free and open-source.

It combines a [desktop application](https://mockoon.com/download/) to design and run mock servers locally, and a [CLI](https://mockoon.com/cli/) to self-host your fake APIs. A [cloud](#subscribe-to-mockoon-cloud) is also available to collaborate with your team, keep your data in sync, and deploy your mock APIs.

API mocking helps you speed up development and third-party API integration by reducing dependency on external services and their limitations: rate limits, costs, availability, etc.
It also allows you to test your applications in a controlled environment with predictable responses, status codes, and latencies, and easily simulate edge cases and error scenarios.
Finally, you can onboard new team members faster by providing them with a consistent and reliable environment to test and develop their applications.

## GitHub Action Usage

Mockoon CLI, being a JavaScript application, can run on any environment where Node.js is installed, including continuous integration systems like GitHub Actions.

This GitHub Action allows you to run Mockoon CLI in your workflows.

Several parameters are available to customize the behavior of the action:

- The `version` of the CLI, default to `latest`.
- The `data-file`, pointing to a [Mockoon data file](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/mockoon-data-files/data-files-location/) stored in the repository.
- A `port` on which the mock server will run, default to `3000`.

```yaml
name: Mockoon CLI demo

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  mockoon-cli-demo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Mockoon CLI
        uses: mockoon/cli-action@v2
        with:
          # Mockoon CLI version, default to 'latest'
          version: "latest"
          # Mockoon local data file or URL
          data-file: "./mockoon-data.json"
          # port, default to 3000
          port: 3000
      - name: Make test call
        run: curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/endpoint
```
